        <p>She was a wise old hen.</p>
        <p>The young hens followed her,<br>Every stubbornly slow step reminding them;
            <br>even the roosters respected her,<br>to avoid a violent peck<br>to the face.
            <br>The flock would tell you,<br>if they could speak,<br> better watch your step,
            <br>lest she put your life to rest in your sleep.</p>
        <p>Zebee sure was one wise old hen.<br>But I bet,<br>those young hens,
            <br>are sure glad they'll never see her again.</p>
