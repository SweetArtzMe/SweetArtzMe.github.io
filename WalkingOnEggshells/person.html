        <p style>Owning chickens is like having shitty freeloaders in your backyard.
            <br>Literally.
            <br>They shit every 20 minutes.
            <br>They'll only give you the stuff they don't want as payment;
            <br>eggs.
            <br>I laugh when I hear someone say that eating eggs is wrong.
            <br>My hens don't care.
            <br>In fact, they actually eat their own eggs sometimes.
            <br>Oh and chicken too.
            <br>Little canibals lol.</p>
